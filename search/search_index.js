The file should be in the sketch data folder. This method is useful if you just want to mess with the frames yourself and don't need the playback possibilities. The method is static, so you have no separate thread going.</p> <pre><code>PImage[] allFrames = Gif.getPImages(this, \"lavalamp.gif\");\n</code></pre> <p>The second way to access the animation is to play it like a video.
